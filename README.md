# EatWell

# Team Name: CL301 - 4Grams

## Overview
we are building an AI-ML based web application **EatWell**. 
**EatWell** uses a large dataset of packaged food products to analyse the contents and display the right amount of nutrients, it categorises them as beneficial, neutral and harmful. 
Moreover, Sameer now can fill in his and his family’s health details to get product recommendations based on their current and past health conditions, getting the right information about products that can trigger the allergies. 
A step further he’ll also be recommended about healthier alternatives to the product he scanned.  
Thereby NutriCheck helps every Indian household to become more aware about their food consumption, makes them health conscious and improves social sustainability.

## Problem Statement
  Sameer, a young man, lives with his family in a city. 
  He has two kids who are allergic to some food items. 
  Sameer often finds himself fooled by packaged food companies and ends up buying bad quality products that do not have good nutrients, proteins and vitamins content. 
  Moreover his kids face issues due to low transparency of information on products and use of abstruse language. 
  Sameer tries scanning barcodes on the packages but they do not work most of the time and many just redirect him to their website.
